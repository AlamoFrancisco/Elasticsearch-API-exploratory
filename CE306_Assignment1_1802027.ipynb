She finds a fan when enables her to shrink enough to get into the \"Garden\" and try to get a \"Dog\" to play with her. She enters the \"White Rabbit\\'s tiny House,\" but suddenly resumes her normal size. In order to get out, she has to use the \"magic fan.\"\\r\\nShe enters a kitchen, in which there is a cook and a woman holding a baby. She persuades the woman to give her the child and takes the infant outside after the cook starts throwing things around. The baby then turns into a pig and squirms out of her grip. \"The Duchess\\'s Cheshire Cat\" appears and disappears a couple of times to Alice and directs her to the Mad Hatter\\'s \"Mad Tea-Party.\" After a while, she leaves.\\r\\nThe Queen invites Alice to join the \"ROYAL PROCESSION\": a parade of marching playing cards and others headed by the White Rabbit. When Alice \"unintentionally offends the Queen\", the latter summons the \"Executioner\". Alice \"boxes the ears\", then flees when all the playing cards come for her. Then she wakes up and realizes it was all a dream.'}"

       "     'Plot': 'The film opens with a sequence in which D\\'Artagnan (Douglas Fairbanks) rides up to a tavern on horseback and ends up brawling with sword and fist with the patrons inside in his haste to approach a fair young stranger. After triumphing, he morphs into modern day Ned Thacker (also played by Fairbanks).\\r\\nNed is born and raised in Kansas by a mother who passes along to him her love of D\\'Artagnan and The Three Musketeers, despite his father\\'s concern that it is not good for him. In fact, Ned does get into trouble with his (sometimes unwanted) chivalrous attempts to help women. Finally, Ned can stand it no more; he decides to leave dull Kansas. In mirroring scenes, D\\'Artagnan is astride a somewhat less-than-noble steed, a present from his father for his departure from home, while Ned\\'s father gives him the modern equivalent: a car.\\r\\nWhile driving in the desert, he comes upon a chauffeur-driven automobile stopped because the road ahead has been washed away. Unimpressed with one passenger, the middle-aged Forrest Vandeteer (the \"richest man in Yonkers\"), Ned is quite taken with the lovely \"Park Avenue flapper\" Elsie Dodge. Her mother, the third passenger, sees her only daughter\\'s marriage to Vandeteer as the solution to their dire financial straits. Vandeteer buys what he wants, and he wants Elsie. She, however, loathes her suitor; she much prefers young Ned.\\r\\nNed comes up with the idea to put his car on railroad tracks. He takes the party (with Elsie in the front seat beside him) to their Grand Canyon resort hotel. There, Vandeteer tells Ned to stay away from the ladies. John Blabb, who works for \"Town Topics\", informs Ned that Vandeteer already has three wives hidden away somewhere.\\r\\nMeanwhile, Chin-de-dah, the Native American leader of an outlaw gang hiding in a tributary canyon, is bored. He decides to kidnap a white woman to be his wife (his last \"wife\" is shown to have committed suicide). He goes to the resort, pretending to be a guide, and selects Elsie as his target. Ned is suspicious, but Vandeteer hires him. Vandeteer and Elsie set out for a horse ride down the canyon with their guide. Ned uses the time to persuade Mrs. Dodge that her daughter\\'s happiness should take priority over their financial security.\\r\\nJames Brown, a member of the gang who knows and hates Vandeteer, gleefully tells Ned about the man\\'s impending demise and Chin-de-dah\\'s intentions toward Elsie. Ned shames him into helping with a rescue. They reach the camp in time to free Elsie and Vandeteer, but remain in peril. Vandeteer offers Ned $100,000 to save his life; Ned makes him put it in writing. Then they are lifted up the sheer cliff by a rope pulled by a horse. Once they are safe, Brown wants to kill Vandeteer, who falsely incriminated him in Vandeteer\\'s own scam and stole his wife and children. Vandeteer ends up clinging to the cliffside, kept from falling to his death only by Ned\\'s grip. Under Ned\\'s direction, he writes a note exonerating Brown. Ned persuades Brown to let Vandeteer live, and promises to split the reward with him. Once they are alone, Elsie kisses her rescuer.'},\n",

Chingachgook (Theodore Lorch) sends his son Uncas (Roscoe), the last living warrior of the Mohican tribe, to warn the fort\\'s commander, Colonel Munro (James Gordon), of the imminent danger. Uncas is admired by Munro\\'s daughter Cora (Barbara Bedford), much to the displeasure of her suitor, Captain Randolph (George Hackathorne).\\r\\nMunro dispatches Major Heyward (Henry Woodward) and an Indian runner named Magua (Beery) to escort Cora and her \"capricious\" younger sister Alice (Hall) to the relative safety of Fort Edward, and to deliver an urgent request for reinforcements to its commander, General Webb (Sydney Deane). Magua, who is a Huron sympathizer with ulterior motives, convinces Heyward to take a \"shortcut\" through a forest, then pretends to lose his way. In the forest they encounter Uncas, Chingachgook and the hunter and scout Hawkeye (Harry Lorraine), accompanied by an eccentric preacher named David Gamut (Nelson McDowell). When Heyward asks for directions to Fort Edward, the men become suspicious of Magua who, like all Indians in the area, should have an intimate knowledge of the terrain. Their fears of treachery are confirmed when they discover that Magua has disappeared.\\r\\nUncas and Hawkeye conceal Heyward and the women in a cave, but Magua and his men find the hiding place, and after a fierce firefight the women are captured. Magua offers to spare \"Golden Hair\" (Alice) if Cora will become his squaw; but Uncas, Chingachgook and Hawkeye counterattack and rescue the hostages. Although they leave Magua for dead, he is actually uninjured.\\r\\nAt Fort William Henry the situation is dire. The only thing keeping the besiegers at bay is a formidable gun emplacement on the left rampart. The cowardly Captain Randolph informs Montcalm, the French commander, that the rampart guns are nonfunctional, leaving Munro no choice but to surrender the fort. Though promised safe passage for the women and children, the Hurons, under the influence of French-supplied whiskey, slaughter the civilians and torch the fort.\\r\\nMagua kidnaps the Munro sisters for a second time and flees. Uncas and Hawkeye pursue him, but Magua reaches a neutral Delaware village. The dispute is taken before a Delaware council of three; their judgment is that Cora be released to Uncas, and that Alice remain with Magua. To save her sister, Cora offers to take her place. Uncas vows that Magua will not leave with his true love; but by Delaware law, Magua is protected until sundown.\\r\\nThat night, Cora escapes and is pursued by Magua to the edge of a precipice. She threatens to jump if he approaches, so Magua waits patiently for her to fall asleep. When she does, he grabs her arm. She flings herself off the cliff, but Magua still has hold of her arms. When Uncas appears, the situation is reversed: Cora tries to save herself, but Magua uses his knife to pry her fingers loose, and she falls to her death. In the ensuing fight, Magua stabs Uncas, whose body rolls down the embankment to rest near Cora\\'s. With his final, dying strength, Uncas reaches forth and takes Cora\\'s hand in his. Magua flees when Chingachgook and Hawkeye arrive, but Hawkeye shoots him dead.\\r\\nAt Cora and Uncas\\'s burial ceremony, Chingachgook mourns the passing of his son, the last of the Mohicans.'},\n",

       "     'Plot': \"As described in a film magazine,[2] Jim Montjoy (MacLean), who is engaged to Millicent Lee (Bennett), gowes with his brother Jim (Cooley) to Mexico to make their fortunes. Jim falls in love with a Mexican girl, Diana Ramon (Vale), and a photograph of her gets into Jim's coat pocket. The brothers own a mining claim that Diana's uncle (French) wants to buy, so Jim stays in Mexico to look after the property while Stanley goes to New York to try to obtain a better price. There he discovers Bob Davis (McCullough) is trying to cut him out, so he marries Millicent without delay. As a joke he buys his wife a book titled How to be Happy Though Married, but it ends up giving her jealous thoughts. She finds the photograph of Diana in Stanley's coat pocket and pretends to go away on a visit, but when she returns to the house she finds her husband escorting the original from the photograph and installing her in one of the bedrooms. Jim, having eloped with his Mexican charmer, is back in town and left to buy new clothes, and Jim then leaves without knowing his wife is in the house. The women meet, and although neither can understand the other's language, they get into an argument. Blond Millicent thinks the handsome brunette is trying to steal her husband, while Diana thinks that her sister-in-law is attempting to rob her of her jewels. All is resolved when the men return.\"}},\n",

Logan (Fawcett) and his wife (Bruce) are very religious, and are taken aback when John Jr. (Harron) announces that he plans to leave their Southern farm and go to New York City to get rich. They take him to church and pray until he accepts religion. His sweetheart Jennie Timberlake (Gish) is afraid that he will backslide, which he does when the lure of the city becomes too strong for him. He is gone seven years and returns a rich man, but is not recognized when he returns home, which is now taking in boarders. Meanwhile, his father has fallen on hard times and is trying to get money to pay the farm's mortgage, and plans to murder the stranger staying at his home, not realizing it is his son. In town, there is a bank robbery and the robber is chased to the Logan farm. The mother sees that her son has returned home, and the father's remorse ends only as the family is once more together. It is then revealed that it was the bank robber that had been shot by the father. The faithful Jennie and John Jr. end up together at the end.\"}}]}}"
